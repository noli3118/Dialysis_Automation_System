# *Unburdening Scientists by Automating the Tedious: A Robot-Scientist Partnership for Dialysis in the Wet Lab*

# Introduction
Scientists perform diverse manual procedures that are tedious and laborious. Such procedures are considered a bottleneck for modern experimental science, as they consume time and increase burdens in fields including medicine and material science. Through this automated system, scientists and researchers are able to allocate more time to more labour intensive tasks, and leave the simple transfers to a robot.
